Welcome to the repository for the International Painful Bladder Foundation (IPBF) website.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code of the IPBF website. For security and privacy reasons, sensitive elements such as keys, the database, and the virtual environment have been removed. The code available here is intended for review and educational purposes.

## Getting Started

Please note that since the repository does not include all elements required for a full local deployment (like the database and environment setup), direct running of the website in a local environment might require additional setup.
